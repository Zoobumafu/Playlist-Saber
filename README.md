# Playlist-Saber
This is a playlist editor for BeatSaber.

## Features

- Create and edit playlist details such as name, description, containing songs, and **image**
- View song metadata - name, author, song artist, image
- Button to easily launch the game in desktop mode (built in mode in BeatSaber where you launch the game from your computer and use it with your mouse, can be done manually using fpfc command after the BeatSaber.exe)
- Sorting songs by date (or alternatively name) to find the latest songs you downloaded for an easy access to the songs you actually opened the software for


## Download && Usage
Simply go to the [release page](https://github.com/Zoobumafu/Playlist-Saber/releases) and download the latest version, than install.
Adding and removing songs from playlist is done by doubleclicking on the song name.

## Future Plans - 
# Near Future -
In the comming days and weeks, I will likely only work on bug fixes (if any are found) and on small requested features

# Allot in the Future - 
I will attempt to create a BeatSaver search menu with the option to download songs into a specificied playlist right from there.
