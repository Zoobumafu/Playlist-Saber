# Playlist-Saber
This is a fully featured playlist editor for BeatSaber, meant to replace the out of order BeatList.

## Features

- Create and edit playlist details such as name, description, containing songs, and **image**
- View song metadata - name, author, song artist, image
- Button to easily launch the game in desktop mode (built in mode in BeatSaber where you launch the game from your computer and use it with your mouse, can be done manually using fpfc command after the BeatSaber.exe)
- Sorting songs by date (or alternatively name) to find the latest songs you downloaded for an easy access to the songs you actually opened the software for


## Download && Usage
Simply go to the [release page](https://github.com/Zoobumafu/Playlist-Saber/releases) and download the latest version, than install.
Adding and removing songs from playlist is done by doubleclicking on the song name.

# Future Plans - 
In the short term no changes are planned as I don't have much time currently, I will fix bugs that pop up though.

In the long term, these are some things I thought worth adding - 
##UI
    Keep colorings saved in a text file, in order to keep playlists coloring the same from session to session.
    Help Button on top with screenshots explain how to use the software, the same pop up will be opened on first startup as well.
    Add missing / corrupted songs to song list, with the message that their files are missing and need to be redownloaded

##Functionality
    Allow running the app with another path (in case you have got a few versions of BeatSaber)
    Add an option to download songs that are already inside the playlist, but are missing their files
