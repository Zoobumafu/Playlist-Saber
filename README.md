This is a fully featured playlist editor for BeatSaber, meant to replace the out of order BeatList.

## Features

- Create and edit playlist details such as name, description, containing songs, and **image**
- View song metadata - name, author, song artist, image
- Button to easily launch the game in desktop mode (built in mode in BeatSaber where you launch the game from your computer and use it with your mouse, can be done manually using fpfc command after the BeatSaber.exe)
- Sorting songs by date (or alternatively name) to find the latest songs you downloaded for an easy access to the songs you actually opened the software for
- Filtering songs by Game Modes
- Downloading missing songs (that are already in the playlist)


## Download && Usage

Adding and removing songs from playlist is done by doubleclicking on the song name.
